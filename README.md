## Assignment Idea

Our idea for the assignment is that we would like to make a sort of interactive school map for all the different schools in NP
The Map will be clickable with spots that will bring up information of schools that are at the location.
For example, if the user clicks on the spot on top of block 27, the courses offered in School of ICT will appear and contains the link for the user to click on the head to the NP's website for more information if required

# Ngee Ann Interactive Map Website

<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. -->

## Design Process

We got this idea from Google Maps where upon clicking on certain landmarks, users will be shown information about that place.
This is made mainly for freshmen and Secondary School Students who are unfamiliar with Ngee Ann Polytechic.
Hence, with this interactive map we hope that it will help understand the layout of the campus and information about the different schools easily.

As a user who is looking into Ngee Ann Polytechnic I want easy access to information about the courses and this can be done from interacting with the map.

Note: Map currently only works at 1920 x 1080 Resolution at 125% scale

<!-- Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.  -->

## Features

<!-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. -->

### Existing Features

Navigation Bar - By clicking on the logo of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, it will open a new tab which leads to the main website

Map - Shows the interactive map where upon clicking on the moodles above coloured blocks will show a card with information displayed about the respective schools like the different diplomas offered.

Contact - Leads to a contact form, where users can express their opinions the us. Information submitted will be kept in a database

<!-- - Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future: -->

### Features Left to Implement

1. Making the map and buttons responsive.

<!-- - Another feature idea -->

## Technologies Used

[RestDB](https://restdb.io/)
-This project uses **RestDB** to keep information submitted through the form in our Contact Us page.

<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. -->

## Testing

1. Map:

   1. Go to "Map" page
   2. Try clicking on coloured moodles and verify that a card with information appears
   3. Try clicking on the headers in the card and verify that it opens a new tab to the respective headers.

2. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
   5. If all fields are filled up and submission is successful, a successful message appears

<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
